"""
ELO rating system for fantasy football teams.

This provides an alternative to the Bradley-Terry model in export_team_ratings.py.
ELO ratings update dynamically after each matchup, providing more responsive 
ratings that reflect recent performance.

Features:
- Dynamic K-factor based on vote weight and team experience
- Starting rating of 1500 for all teams
- Logistic probability function for expected outcomes
- Same weighted voting system as Bradley-Terry model
- Per-tournament rating isolation
- Chronological processing of matchups for accurate evolution

Usage:
    python scripts/elo_team_ratings.py [DB_PATH] [OUTPUT_CSV]

Defaults:
    DB_PATH     = ./teams-2025-07-30-1250.db
    OUTPUT_CSV  = elo_team_ratings.csv
